Python project for uplink calculations (with documentation PDF)
# Uplink Link Budget Calculator (Python)

This repository contains a Python project for performing **uplink link budget calculations** for satellite communications.  
It includes the implementation code and a detailed report (in Greek) that explains the methodology, assumptions, and results.

## What this project does
The script helps compute and analyze uplink parameters typically used in satellite link budgets, such as:
- Key uplink/link-budget metrics (e.g., power levels and losses across the uplink chain)
- Budget components and intermediate results for verification
- A structured calculation flow based on standard satellite communications concepts

> Note: The included PDF report is written in Greek, but the code is fully readable and the README explains how to use the project.

## Repository contents
- `Uplink.py` — main Python script (uplink calculations)
- `Uplink_report.pdf` — report/documentation (Greek)

## How to run
### Requirements
- Python 3.x

### Run
Open a terminal in the repository folder and execute:
```bash
python Uplink.py
How to use / Inputs
Depending on how the script was implemented, it may:

use predefined parameters inside the code, or

ask for user input in the terminal.

If you want, you can edit the parameter values directly in Uplink.py to test different scenarios.
